# IBM Cybersecurity Analyst Professional Certificate

To further my skills in cybersecurity I have started to complete a cybersecurity analyst certificate by IBM. This is a course made up of 8 parts:

1. Introduction to Cybersecurity Tools & Cyber Attacks
2. Cybersecurity Roles, Processes & Operating System Security
3. Cybersecurity Compliance Framework & System Administration
4. Network Security & Database Vulnerabilities
5. Penetration Testing, Incident Response and Forensics
6. Cyber Threat Intelligence
7. Cybersecurity Capstone: Breach Response Case Studies
8. IBM Cybersecurity Analyst Assessment

What I'm excited to learn about are the processes and tools available on the job as a cyber security analyst and to get a taste of the real work that they do.

So far, I have completed the first part, which gave an overview of attacks, attackers, and tools used to defend against these attacks. What particularly interested me in this course was learning about the range of cyber attacks, including:

* Packet sniffing
* IP spoofing
* DoS attacks
* Host insertions
* Malware
* Ransomware
* Cyberwarfare

...As well as the cyber kill chain.

Networking is a topic that caught my eye in particular and network defences was also something I particularly enjoyed learning about, including:

* Firewalls - stateful and stateless
* Packet filtering
* XML gateways
