# IBM Cybersecurity Analyst Professional Certificate

To further my skills in cybersecurity I have started to complete a cybersecurity analyst certificate by IBM. This is a course made up of 8 parts:

1. Introduction to Cybersecurity Tools & Cyber Attacks
2. Cybersecurity Roles, Processes & Operating System Security
3. Cybersecurity Compliance Framework & System Administration
4. Network Security & Database Vulnerabilities
5. Penetration Testing, Incident Response and Forensics
6. Cyber Threat Intelligence
7. Cybersecurity Capstone: Breach Response Case Studies
8. IBM Cybersecurity Analyst Assessment

What I'm excited to learn about are the processes and tools available on the job as a cyber security analyst and to get a taste of the real work that they do.
