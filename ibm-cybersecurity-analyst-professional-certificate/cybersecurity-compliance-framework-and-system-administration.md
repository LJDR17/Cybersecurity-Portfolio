# Cybersecurity Compliance Framework & System Administration

This course gave an overview of:

* Compliance frameworks e.g. ISO, regulations e.g. GDPR, HIPAA, and CIS controls.
* Client administration and endpoint patching.
* Windows user administration e.g. using Active Directory
* Windows and Linux file systems and commands
* Cryptography and data encryption

As someone who is interested in IT and breaking into cybersecurity, learning about how users are managed was interesting to learn, especially the different domain level accounts e.g. administrator, guest, HelpAssistant, and KRBTGT, and how Active Directory is used.

As well as this, learning how clients were managed and endpoints protected was also interesting, which included learning about endpoint protection and response systems and unified endpoint management including how to use Xcitium OpenEDR. I also learned about the issue of patching and challenges associated with it.

Furthermore, it was interesting to consider the common pitfalls businesses have when it comes to data encryption, in all kinds of scenarios, whether the data is at rest, in transit, or in use. An assignment was also given here, which involved the use of setting up user and group accounts in Kali Linux, encrypting files using ccrypt, and creating an encrypted email using Mailvelope, which was an enjoyable practical aspect.
